# COVID- 19 SQL & Tableau Project

## Objective

 The objective of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 data using SQL and visualize key insights using Tableau. The analysis will focus on understanding patterns and trends in COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations across different continents, countries, and time periods. Specifically, we aim to compare the impact of the pandemic on a large scale.

## Data Overview

- The dataset consists of 2 CSV files: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations..
- You can access the dataset from the [**Our World In Data**](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) website.The data is completely open access under the Creative Commons BY license.
- The dataset covers 182 countries around the globe.
- The data spans from January 22, 2020, to April 30, 2021.

## Data Limitation
- The dataset only includes data up to April 2021. Therefore, the analysis will focus on the first months and year of the pandemic.
- Not all countries have a well-established health system, and reporting can be highly unreliable. This can lead to discrepancies and inaccuracies in the data.
- The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths due to limited testing and problems in the attribution of the cause of death. The difference between reported confirmed deaths and actual deaths varies by country.
- How COVID-19 deaths are recorded may differ between countries. For example, some countries may only count hospital deaths, while others also include deaths in homes. This variation in recording practices can affect the comparability of data between countries.
